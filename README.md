DEAD EXPLOSION MOTHER is a stage debgging tool/novelty character for the Ikemen Go engine, inspired by Tatsuki Fujimoto's oneshot manga "Sayonara Eri". You can use it to test the deltas on your stages. Or you can use it to take funny screenshots, I don't really care.

- It can move the camera freely around the stage, ignoring the usual limitations of fighting game logic.
- It can hide lifebars (character specific HUD might still be present).
- It can zoom in, even if the stage itself does not natively support zoom.
- It can freeze its opponent in place, and even vanish it entirely.
- It can display a cute smartphone camera HUD over the fight.
